# Deep NLP Implementations

This repository documents my deep dive into **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, with an focus on **implementation-driven understanding supported by relevant theory**.

I am **Suresh Jakhar**, a **Machine Learning Engineer**.  
This repository serves as a technical record of my work, where NLP concepts are explored through concrete implementations, controlled experiments, and concise technical notes.


The objective of this repository is to:
- strengthen my understanding of core NLP methods,
- implement foundational algorithms from scratch where appropriate,
- develop a clear, end-to-end perspective on practical NLP system design.

The repository evolves incrementally as topics are studied in depth.

## Scope

Focus is on classical and foundational NLP techniques, including:
- text preprocessing and normalization,
- text representation methods (Bag of Words, TF-IDF),
- word embeddings (Word2Vec: CBOW and Skip-gram),
- text classification pipelines,
- sequence modeling concepts such as POS tagging using Hidden Markov Models,
- semantic similarity and duplicate question detection.

Implementations prioritize clarity, correctness, and conceptual transparency.

## Prerequisites

Prior working knowledge of the following areas.  
Introductory explanations are intentionally omitted.

- Python for data analysis and model development  
- NumPy and vectorized numerical computation  
- Core Machine Learning concepts:
  - supervised learning
  - optimization and loss functions
  - model evaluation metrics
- Linear algebra relevant to ML:
  - vectors, matrices, dot products

## Repository Structure

The codebase is organized by topic, following a logical progression from NLP fundamentals to structured probabilistic models.  
Each directory typically contains:
- implementation notebooks,
- a dedicated README explaining the underlying concepts, design decisions, and observations.

## Notes

- Large datasets are intentionally excluded; dataset sources are documented where required.
- This is a learning-driven repository; code quality and abstractions improve as understanding deepens.
- Some notebooks favor interpretability and experimentation over performance.

## Disclaimer

This repository reflects an ongoing learning process.  
Content may be revised, refactored, or reorganized as insights mature.
